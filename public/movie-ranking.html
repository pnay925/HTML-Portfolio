 <h2>My top 5 Disney Movies of all-time.</h2>

 <hr />

<h3>Mulan</h3>
<p>One of my favorite because it women empowerment. It showed how resilient she is.</p>
<h3>Snow White</h3>
<p>It's just nostalgia. I remembered my dad taking us to this movie when I was little and he bought a dog toy with a slinky in the middle, I forgot what it's called.</p>
<h3>Moana</h3>
<p>Again for the same reason as Mulan, women empowerment, resilience, and smart. Also, showed a little bit of the Hawaiian culture.</p>
<h3>Aristocats</h3>
<p>Cupcake ipsum dolor. Sit amet marshmallow topping cheesecake muffin. Halvah croissant candy canes bonbon candy. Apple pie jelly beans topping carrot cake danish tart cake cheesecake. Muffin danish chocolate souffl√© pastry icing bonbon oat cake. Powder cake jujubes oat cake. Lemon drops tootsie roll marshmallow halvah carrot cake.</p>
<h3>Mary Poppins</h3>
<p>It just brings me back to my childhood. Plus I love Julie Andrews. I also love her in Sound of Music. And currently love her as the voice of Lady Whistledown.</p>
